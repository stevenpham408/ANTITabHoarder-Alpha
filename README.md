# ANTI-TabHoarder (Alpha version)
ANTI-TabHoarder is a Google Chrome extension that aims to help tab hoarders control their hoarding and also to prevent them from relapsing into their hoarding ways.

## Functionality
The extension revolves around two main features: the Auto-Delete & the Tab Manager.

#### Auto-Delete
The Auto-Delete feature acts as preventative care for tab hoarders. Once toggled on, tab hoarders will be able to input a certain amount of time in minutes or hours, in which newly created tabs will be deleted after the specified delay. 

#### Tab Manager
The Tab Manager role in the treatment for tab hoarding is twofoldâ€”acting as both preventative care and also instantaneous relief. Users are able to view an interactive table after enabling the feature. The table displays the following information about tabs currently open in the window: title of the tab, the last visited date that the user viewed it, & the time elapsed that the user spent viewing it. Users will be able to select any number of tabs from the Tab Manager table & quickly dispose of the tabs based on the information given to them.
